# DLBEC-SM
DLBEC Spreadsheet Manipulator, in progress.

## Tools ##
This repo contains a few tools that I developed for DLBEC for the manipulation of .xlsx spreadsheets.
They are able to search and append xlsx spreadsheets among a few other functionalites.
They utilise pandas for spreadsheet manipulation.
And TTKBootstrap for the ui elements.

## Why? ##
These tools automate some of the tasks I have to conduct when doing my job with DLBEC.
Making it quicker and easier to do.

## Disclaimer ##
I did make use of AI when developing these applications, meaning that some of the code is not original.
While this may be true, I fully understand this code and how it achieves what it does.
